## Lessons Learned from convertHexToRGB

I learned that the `parseInt` function accepts two arguments: a string and an optional radix (base). `parseInt(string, radix)` lets us convert strings to numerical values even if they are not in base 10.  This makes it a very convienient function when working with hexadecimal values.

## Lessons Learned from primeFactors
I learned that to write down the prime factor decomposition for n I don't necessarily have to find all primes up to n. I can just iterate i from 2, 3, ... , n and anytime n is divisible by i, i must be a prime factor since we're incrementing i up from 2. If keep dividing n by i until it is no longer divisible than we gather all the prime factors of n from smallest to largest.

## Lessons Learned from breakCamelCase
Boolean checks with a more "functional" style are easier to read. 

## Lessons Learned from arrayHelpers
I learned that there are two main ways of extending the `Array` "class" or constructor function. The first is to simply add methods to the `Array.prototype` property directly. Although this works, the better way of extending the `Array` class is to use the `Object.defineProperty(obj, propName, options)` method. `obj` is the object on which to define the property, `propName` is the name of the property and `options` is an object with the property value and other configuration options. Using this, we can define a new property on any object and it will be NOT be enumerable or writable by default. This means that the new property will not show up in a `for ... of` iteration and the property cannot be reassigned.

## Lessons Learned from titleCaes
I learned that reassigning elements using the first parameter of the `forEach` loop is not possible. However, the `forEach` loop comes with additional parameters to help with this.  Using all three parameters in the form `forEach(elem, idx, arr)` lets to perform a reassignment of `arr` at index `idx` as you loop through the array by using the syntax `arr[idx] = ...`.
