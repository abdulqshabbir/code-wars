## Lessons Learned from convertHexToRGB

I learned that the `parseInt` function accepts two arguments: a string and an optional radix (base). `parseInt(string, radix)` lets us convert strings to numerical values even if they are not in base 10.  This makes it a very convienient function when working with hexadecimal values.

## Lessons Learned from primeFactors
I learned that to write down the prime factor decomposition for n I don't necessarily have to find all primes up to n. I can just iterate i from 2, 3, ... , n and anytime n is divisible by i, i must be a prime factor since we're incrementing i up from 2. If keep dividing n by i until it is no longer divisible than we gather all the prime factors of n from smallest to largest.
